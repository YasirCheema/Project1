            <h3>Flex and comfortable</h3>
            <p>The most barefoot-like and lightest of the Free family, the Nike Free RN Flyknit 2017 Women's Running Shoe is ideal for short runs.
                <br />A sock-like upper hugs your feet yet feels barely there, while an innovative sole lets your foot flex and expand naturally.
                <br />And, their packable design is easy to stash in a tote or backpack—so you pack in a few miles on the fly.</p><br />
